   <h4>A simple one pan recipe that is filling and delicious</h4>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>12 ounces uncooked egg noodles</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 medium onion chopped</li>
      <li>2-3 cloves garlic minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
      <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
      <li>Boil a salted pot of water for the egg noodles and cook according to package directions.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, add the ground beef and onion to a skillet. Cook over medium-high heat, breaking the meat up as you go along, until it's nicely browned (about 10 minutes). Don't drain the fat unless you're not using lean ground beef (then drain a bit but still leave at least a couple tablespoons of it in the pan).</li>
      <li>Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and Italian seasoning, and cook for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Stir in the flour and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring often (this cooks the raw flour taste out).</li>
      <li>Gradually pour in the beef broth while stirring until the flour has dissolved and scraping any stuck-on bits from the bottom of the pan. </li>
      <li>Continue cooking for another 5-10 minutes (stir occasionally) or until the gravy has thickened to your liking. If it gets too thick, add in a splash more beef broth. </li>
      <li>Drain the cooked egg noodles, add them to the skillet, and toss with the beef mixture. Season with salt & pepper if needed and serve immediately. </li>
   </ol>
